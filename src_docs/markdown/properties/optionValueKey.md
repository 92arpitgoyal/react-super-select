<!-- optionValueKey -->
 (**String**) *optional*

 (defaults to using ‘id’ as the key if left undefined)

  This value represents the key in each option object (from the **dataSource** collection), which represents the value that uniquely identifies that option across the dataSource collection. 

  Think of it in terms of the value attribute of the html option tag (inside a select)
```html
  <select>
    <option value="?">
```
