<!-- forceDefaultBrowserScrolling property -->
(**Boolean**) **(Default: false)** *optional*

Whether or not the control allows browser default onWheel scroll handling in an open dropdown.  

By default, mousewheel events are arrested so that the control will not scroll out of view as the end of its results set is reached.  When this prop is set to true, the handler that stops the page scrolling will be bypassed.
