TASKS
1) fix build sequence via npm
2) clear selection button
  - need to figure out keyboard nav for it with clearing (this and tags)

keyboard nav needs some love
3) spec for clear search

4) research other aria control options 


TENTATIVE
1) list groups should be separately focus-able and navigable?
Change groups to http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H85.html
ex: <optgroup label="Fruits"

Cannot use optgroup in combobox/listbox - can this be reconciled?
