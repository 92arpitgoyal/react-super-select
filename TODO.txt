TASKS
1) tweak/adjust build sequence via npm
2) sass watch while working.  - possibly with foreman?
3) decide when to uptake React >14

3) research other aria control options

TENTATIVE
1) list groups should be separately focus-able and navigable?
Change groups to http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H85.html
ex: <optgroup label="Fruits"

Cannot use optgroup in combobox/listbox - can this be reconciled?
